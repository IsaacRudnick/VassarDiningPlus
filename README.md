## Overview

An Android app meant to improve upon Vassar's existing dining services website. This app has several features that the official website does not, such as the ability to favorite dishes and check which favorites are being served on a day, a more persistent allergen profile, and offline browsing via cached menus. Developed in partnership with Sasha Poor.

The app features MVC architecture, unit and system/integration testing, Javadoc for all functions, use cases, activity diagrams, functional and nonfunctional specifications, test reports, class diagrams for all major features, and more. Made in Java using Android Studio.

| [User.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/User.java)                 | The `User.java` file within the `intellij/src` directory serves a vital role in the VassarDiningPlus application. It represents a user profile that contains dietary restrictions. The code's function is to filter, analyze, and determine which dishes from the menu the user can consume based on their dietary restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Constants.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Constants.java)       | The Constants.java file within the intellij/src directory of the VassarDiningPlus repository serves primarily to hold globally accessible, unalterable data. In this case, it stores the URL of the cafe menu webpage as a static final variable, facilitating its usage across different components of the project without redundancy or potential for error.                                                                                                                                         |
| [Controller.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Controller.java)     | The Controller.java file in the intellij/src directory of the VassarDiningPlus repository manages the business logic of the application. It primarily handles user creation with dietary restrictions and validates these restrictions. It also provides functionalities to convert restriction IDs to restriction names and fetches menu data for a particular day based on the user's restrictions.                                                                                                  |
| [Dish.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Dish.java)                 | The Dish.java file, within the intellij/src directory, serves as a blueprint for creating Dish objects in the VassarDiningPlus application. It manages dish information including its id, name, description, and restrictions. Through its methods, it provides functionalities like checking dish restrictions and fetching the dish's details. This file contributes to the overall data structure of the VassarDiningPlus application.                                                              |
| [TextView.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/TextView.java)         | The TextView.java file in the intellij/src directory provides a text-based interface for VassarDiningPlus application. This code accepts user inputs for dietary restrictions and a date, then retrieves and displays the corresponding meals for the given date, adhering to any user-inputted restrictions. If the user enters quit, the application will exit. The interface interacts with the Controller class to validate restrictions and create a user profile with the provided restrictions. |
| [DayLibrary.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/DayLibrary.java)     | The DayLibrary.java file is critical to the VassarDiningPlus repository, as it houses the functionality for managing the dining days. Specifically, it centralizes the creation and storage of unique Day objects, which represent specific dining days, pre-filtered by user restrictions. The design aims to avoid duplications and facilitate efficient retrieval of previously created Day objects, thus enhancing the application's performance by promoting data reusability through caching.    |
| [Restrictions.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Restrictions.java) | The Restrictions.java code exists in the intellij/src directory of the VassarDiningPlus repository. It's primary function is to manage a map of dietary restriction IDs to their names. This includes providing features to check if a restriction ID is valid, and to retrieve corresponding names for given IDs in the context of meal planning. This contributes to overall data integrity and user customization within the application.                                                           |
| [Day.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Day.java)                   | This java file, Day.java, in the Intellij directory of the VassarDiningPlus repository, is primarily responsible for representing a single day within the application. It maintains a map relating menu names to their corresponding menus and has fields for a user and a date. It's mainly used to construct Day instances, with provisions for caching in future updates.                                                                                                                           |
| [Menu.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/intellij/src/Menu.java)                 | The Menu.java file forms a crucial part of the VassarDiningPlus repository, residing within the intellij/src subdirectory. This code establishes a Menu class, which encapsulates details about a food menu, storing the menu's name and its constituent dishes. The class enables operations such as adding a dish and retrieving the menu's name or list of dishes. It also offers a formatted string representation of the menu for presenting the data in a readable layout.                       |

| [UserTest.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/astudio/app/src/test/java/edu/vassar/cmpu203/app/model/UserTest.java)             | This code sits within the test suite of the VassarDiningPlus application, specifically validating the User model's functionality, such as dietary restrictions and the ability to eat certain dishes. It verifies the correct functioning of these features by creating different User instances and Dish objects, then executing and checking the results of method calls, including equality checks. These tests ensure the robustness of the User class and its methods within the application's larger structure. |
| [DayTest.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/astudio/app/src/test/java/edu/vassar/cmpu203/app/model/DayTest.java)               | The DayTest.java file tests the functionality of the Day class in the VassarDiningPlus app. Specifically, it verifies the correct string representation of a day's menu (testToString method) and ensures that the method to filter and display only a user's favorite dishes works properly (withOnlyFavoritesOf method).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [DayLibraryTest.java](https://github.com/InformationlessUsername/VassarDiningPlus/blob/master/astudio/app/src/test/java/edu/vassar/cmpu203/app/model/DayLibraryTest.java) | The DayLibraryTest.java file is responsible for ensuring the correctness of two key functionalities within the VassarDiningPlus application: managing user dietary restrictions and retrieving specific day data. The file contains unit tests that confirm the data integrity when user restrictions are set and ensure the day data fetched, including station names, is as expected.                                                                                                                               |

As part of the Android Studio's app module, it handles the presentation of different fragments within the main activity. By implementing the IMainView interface, it defines how user interactions, like clicks on the menu and profile buttons, are handled, and how they result in the display of corresponding fragments. It also manages the addition and replacement of these fragments within the application's view hierarchy. |
